# SDWebImageCrashTest
A simple reproducible crash in SDWebImage

This simple project only attempts to download one image: https://s-passets-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/images/about/logos/Pinterest_Favicon.png

Be sure to install SDWebImage via Cocoapods.

Run the project, and the memory continues to climb until it crashes.
